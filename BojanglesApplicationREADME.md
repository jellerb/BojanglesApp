## Installation

In order to run our project, it would be best to use a phone emulator, however, in order to easily utilize an android emulator and view the code at the same time, use Android Studio.

| IDE | Link |
| ------ | ------ |
|Android Studio Download | https://developer.android.com/studio|
**Make sure you have at least 500 MB of space available for the installation* 

Once installed, open and run Android Studio.  A pop up window will appear querying about allowing Android Studio to make changes to the device, select allow.

The setup window will appear. Click Next until you see install then select install… this will install android studio onto your device, the step before installing allows the user to select a folder to have projects go into. Then click next and then finish.

After the installation setup is complete, Android Studio will open for the first time. When the application is initially installed, a prompt will appear to help improve Android Studio by sending statistics to Google. Select either, it does not matter.

Go through the initial setup process for Android Studio and agree to the License Agreement.  

When the *Welcome to Android Studio* window pops up, click *Open* and select the folder containing this README.  

After Opening the IDE and the project select device manager, in the top right corner of Android Studio’s toolbar. (This is where we will be initializing and creating the emulator environment. If you have an AMD processor you will need to change a setting in BIOS)

After clicking “Create Device” you will then be taken to this screen where you can select the exact device they you like to use for their emulation. 

Use 'Q' as your selected system image for the emulator.  

Now that the IDE and the Emulator are set up. When the gradle is synced, the application is ready to be run and can be run with the green play button located in the middle of the toolbar in Android Studio.

**It's Bo Time!**
